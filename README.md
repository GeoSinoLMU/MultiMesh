# MultiMesh
A python library to use when working with multiple meshes and one needs to interpolate parameters between them.

## Ways to use it
There are two ways to interact with the library.

### Command line
Through the command line where it is possible to use a few functions like:
"interpolate_mesh_a_to_b"
which interpolates parameters from exodus mesh a to exodus mesh b. It also has other functions which use HDF5 types of meshes.

### API
Importing multi_mesh into a python script and using the api is also an option. Through that portal there are more functionalities available and that is also the only thing that works in 2D.
